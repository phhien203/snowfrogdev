# ngx-unleash-proxy-client

This library is meant to be used with the [unleash-proxy](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-proxy). The proxy application layer will sit between your unleash instance and your client applications, and provides performance and security benefits. DO NOT TRY to connect this library directly to the unleash instance, as the datasets follow different formats because the proxy only returns evaluated toggle information.

## Getting started

### Step 1: Unleash Proxy

Before you can use this Unleash SDK you need to set up a Unleash Proxy instance. [Read more about the Unleash Proxy](https://docs.getunleash.io/sdks/unleash-proxy).

### Step 2: Install

```bash
npm install @snowfrog/ngx-unleash-proxy-client
```

### Step 3: Initialize the SDK

You need to have a Unleash-hosted instance, and the proxy needs to be enabled. In addition you will need a proxy-specific clientKey in order to connect to the Unleash-hosted Proxy.

Here is how to initialize the client SDK:

```typescript
import { NgxUnleashProxyClientModule } from '@snowfrog/ngx-unleash-proxy-client';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxUnleashProxyClientModule.init({
      url: 'https://unleash-proxy.myapp.com/proxy',
      clientKey: 'MyClientKey',
      appName: 'My Angular App Name',
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This step will initialize the library, before the Angular app is completely bootstrapped, insuring that
the library is ready to use and the toggle data is available before users can interact with the app.

## How to check toggle states

To check if a toggle is enabled from within a Component or Service, you can use the `isEnabled` method:

```typescript
import { UnleashService } from '@snowfrog/ngx-unleash-proxy-client';

@Component({
  selector: 'test-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
})
export class TestComponent {
  constructor(private unleash: UnleashService) {}
  get title(): string {
    if (this.unleash.isEnabled('test.toggle')) {
      return 'The toggle is on';
    }
    return 'The toggle is off';
  }
}
```

To check if a toggle is enabled from within a Component template, you can use the `unleash` and `unleashNot`
directives:

```html
<some-component *unleash="'test.toggle'"></some-component>
<some-other-component *unleashNot="'test.toggle'"></some-other-component>
```

To prevent navigation to a route based on a toggle, you can use the `UnleashGuard`:

```typescript
import { UnleashGuard } from '@snowfrog/ngx-unleash-proxy-client';

const routes = [
  {
    path: 'test',
    component: TestComponent,
    canActivate: [UnleashGuard],
    data: { toggleName: 'test.toggle', shouldBe: true, redirectUrl: '/' },
  },
];
```

To check variants:

```typescript
import { UnleashService } from '@snowfrog/ngx-unleash-proxy-client';

@Component({
  selector: 'test-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
})
export class TestComponent {
  constructor(private unleash: UnleashService) {}
  get title(): string {
    const variant = this.unleash.getVariant('test.variant');
    if(variant === 'blue) {
      // something with variant blue
    }
}
```

## How to update the Unleash Context

Follow the following steps in order to update the Unleash context:

```typescript
import { UnleashService } from '@snowfrog/ngx-unleash-proxy-client';

@Injectable()
export class SomeService {
  constructor(private unleash: UnleashService) {}

  someOperation() {
    this.unleash.updateContext({
      userId: '123',
      userName: 'John Doe',
      userEmail: 'john@doe.com',
    });
  }
}
```
